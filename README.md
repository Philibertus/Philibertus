- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Philibertus
- ğŸ‘€ I'm a curious mixed biochemist/cell biologist/data scientist who's keen on learning new ways to combine data to
generate valuable insights in biological phenomena and elucidate mechanisms.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning RShiny to visualize and provide data to biologists and simultaneously try to expand my python programming skills.
- ğŸ“« You can reach me via philibertus88@gmail.com.

Cheers!
